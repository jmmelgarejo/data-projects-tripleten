## Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I used a movie reviews dataset with polarity labeling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. Involves pre-processing text data for vectorization and training classification models to select the best model by test scores. Leverages large language models (LLMs) to classify user reviews as positive or negative sentiment.

## Insurance Benefits Obfuscated Model

In this project, I created a predictive model to identify which users are likely to utilize insurance benefits, estimating the number of benefits customers are likely to receive. This model involves obfuscating data for privacy and data security.

## Computer Vision - Predicting Customer Age

This project creates and tests a model to predict customer age based on photographs. This serves as a baseline for future projects involving computer vision and machine learning.
